ActiveImage
============

An easy to use jQuery plugin that allows you to target images and have them expand on an event. Follow the link to see it in action [ActiveImage](http://mindkittens.com).

Usage
------------
Just add the 'active-image.js' file to your project:

    <script src="your-project/active-image.js"></script>

And call the plugin:

    $( 'img' ).activeImage();

Thats it! The plugin handles the math so that your image retains its aspec ratio and fits within the viewport.
